**Hello. I'd like to introduce you my first .NET appliaction.**

The application was created to manage alcohols by the user. It has a database of products which users create their own. 
Users could create, remove, update, delete produts.
He might even receive suggestions what alcohol he could make from his ingredients.
User could quickly calculate the starting sugar for the production of his wine by providing the appropriate parameters.
